# Hemp Processing Optimization & Financial Planning Model (Excel Solver-Based)

This project is an Excel-based operational and financial planning tool for a hemp processing business. It models acreage planning, processing capacity, inventory flow, customer shipments, and monthly revenue forecasts, all driven by real contract and equipment cost data.

The tool is built in Microsoft Excel and uses Solver and SolverTable to simulate processing scenarios, optimize investment decisions, and forecast 2025 performance under different constraints.

## Project Objectives

- Maximize 2025 profit by evaluating acreage and equipment upgrade plans
- Align production capacity with real customer shipment contracts
- Forecast monthly and annual cash flow with inventory and channel breakdowns
- Assess ROI of specific capital upgrades using Solver and cost modeling

## Key Components

### 1. Processing System & Inputs
- Core parameters: processing time/day, days/week, tons/hour, cost/acre, and yield/acre
- Projected biomass production and associated raw material costs

### 2. Sales Contracts & Revenue Forecast
- Shipments and price-per-pound by customer (e.g., Tiger Fiber, Hempitecture)
- Split across fiber, hurd, and consumer channels
- Monthly revenue projections from both wholesale and consumer sales streams

### 3. Inventory & Material Flow
- Tracks production volumes, lbs sold, and unsold inventory by product type
- Includes final inventory value and product distribution mix across fiber, hurd, fines, and dust

### 4. Capital Expenditure Planning
- Equipment upgrade cost breakdown (e.g., feed master, aspirator, separator)
- Manual cost options and scaled alternatives for equipment planning
- Total and scaled investment options listed for operational planning

### 5. Financial Model (2025)
- Revenue and cost projections by month
- Segregated wholesale vs. consumer revenue
- Full-year summary:  
  - **Total Revenue**: $3.97M  
  - **Operating Expenses**: $500,400  
  - **Net Operating Income (pre-tax and CapEx)**: ~$3.47M

### 6. Solver & SolverTable Use
- Solver is used to determine profit-maximizing acreage and capacity under equipment constraints
- SolverTable facilitates multi-scenario simulation (e.g., acreage changes, upgrade cost variations)

## Business Impact

- **Helps optimize capital spending** by identifying ROI-maximizing upgrades
- **Supports production and contract planning** by comparing monthly throughput with sales commitments
- **Enables margin analysis** by tracking channel-specific revenue and processing costs
- Useful for internal decision-making or investment planning in a real-world agri-processing setting
